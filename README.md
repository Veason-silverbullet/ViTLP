# ViTLP
This repository releases code of paper [**Visually Guided Generative Text-Layout Pre-training for Document Intelligence** (NAACL-2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.264.pdf).


We provide the pre-trained checkpoint **ViTLP-medium** (380M). The pre-trained ViTLP model can natively perform OCR text localization and recognition, which is accessible at [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/veason/ViTLP-medium/tree/main). Clone (or download) ViTLP checkpoint weight to the directory `./ckpts/ViTLP-medium`.

<pre><code>git clone ViTLP && cd ViTLP
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clone ViTLP-medium checkpoint
mkdir -p ckpts/ViTLP-medium
git clone https://huggingface.co/veason/ViTLP-medium ckpts/ViTLP-medium</code></pre>


# Demo
With the checkpoint and dependencies set (see requirements.txt), run the demo as

<pre><code>python ocr.py</code></pre>

Upload a document image and have a shot.

See detailed inference code at `decode.py` and run batch decode by

<pre><code>bash decode.sh</code></pre>


# Fintuning ViTLP
Please refer to [./finetuning](https://github.com/Veason-silverbullet/ViTLP/tree/main/finetuning) for finetuning ViTLP.

We also release a tool for synthesizing documents with grounding-box metadata at [./finetuning/SynthDog-bbox](https://github.com/Veason-silverbullet/ViTLP/tree/main/finetuning/SynthDog-bbox).


# Preset FAQ
- Why is ViTLP-medium (380M)?

  When I commenced this project, it was on the eve of LLMs (precisely speaking, ChatGPT). ViTLP-base presented in our paper, is actually a rather small pre-trained model. We know it is expected to scale up ViTLP in this LLM era. However, the pre-training scale is commonly constrained by computation resources and the pre-training dataset scale, in which context ViTLP-medium (380M) is the largest pre-training scale so far we can support.

  Besides, this scale of ViTLP also brings inference sweetness including speed and memory usage. Typically, OCR on a page of a document image can be processed within 5~10 seconds in an Nvidia 4090, which is comparable to (and faster than) most OCR engines (and LLMs).
