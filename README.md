# ViTLP
This repository is for paper [**Visually Guided Generative Text-Layout Pre-training for Document Intelligence** (NAACL-2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16516). Since I am struggling with my thesis in April, I expect to release ViTLP codes (probably with model checkpoints) in early May. Please stay tuned.


# Note
ViTLP is pronounced /ˈvai·tlp/ (vital). The first version of our paper was submitted to [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ARtBIBAmNR) in June 2023.
